Data Types
============

Magic Set Editor uses many data types in the files and in scripting.
There are for instance :ref:`card`s in :ref:`set`s, :ref:`stylesheet`s describing the layout of :ref:`field`s, etc.

1. :doc:`set <#set>`
2. :ref:`set`
3. :ref:`sets <set>`


File Types
----------

These are the 'major' data types that are written directly to :doc:`/file/packages`.

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 0
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - :ref:`game`
      - What information is on each card?
    * - :ref:`stylesheet`
      - What do cards look like?
    * - :ref:`set`
      - Sets of cards.
    * - :ref:`symbol font`
      - Fonts consisting of symbols, for instance mana symbols.

**Overview**

Games are part of the :doc:`/concepts#style-triangle`:

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 0
    :align: left

    * - Description

      - :ref:`Set`
    * - :ref:`Field`
      - :ref:`Style`	
      - :ref:`Value`

Games provide the ''description'', i.e. what kinds of things are on a card.

**Package format**

A game is described in a :doc:`/file/package` with the ``.mse-game`` file extension.
Such a package contains a :doc:`/file/format|data file` called ``game`` that has the following properties.

    	power: 50

Pack Type
~~~~~~~~~

DOC_MSE_VERSION: since 0.3.8

**Overview**

A type of card packs. For instance "booster" and "tournament pack" are card pack types.

A pack type contains either:
* a filter for selecting the desired kind of cards from the set.
* one or more :ref:`pack item`s, indicating what kinds and how many cards are in the pack.
* a combination of the above.

**Properties**

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Default	
      - Description
    * - ``name``
      - :ref:`string`	
      -  	
      - | Name of this card pack type.
        | Other pack types can refer to this name.
    * - ``select``
      - see below	
      - see below
      - How are instances of this pack generated?
    * - ``enabled``
      - :ref:`scriptable` :ref:`boolean`
      - ``true``	
      - Is this pack type enabled, i.e. can the user select it?
    * - ``selectable``
      - :ref:`boolean`
      - ``true``	
      - Is this pack selectable from the list of packs in the user interface?
    * - ``summary``
      - :ref:`boolean`
      - ``true``	
      - | Is a summary of the total number of cards shown in the second panel in the user interface?<br/>
        | Note: this only applies to pack types that have the ``filter`` property set.
    * - ``filter``
      - :ref:`script`	
      - ''optional''
      - Condition that a card must satisfy to be included in this pack type.
    * - ``items``
      - :ref:`list` of :ref:`pack item`s
      -  	
      - The items to include in this pack.

**Selection**

The ``select`` property specifies how instances of this pack are generated.
When the user selects that he wants 3 copies of pack X, then MSE will generate three ''instances'' of that pack.
How that happens depends on the ``select`` property:

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - ``select``	
      - Description
    * - ``all``
      - | Each instance of this pack type contains all of the filtered cards and ``items``.<br/>
        | In general, ``select: all`` is used for the selectable pack types, while other ``select`` types are used for the rest of the packs.<br/>
        | This is the default for pack types with ``items``.
    * - ``replace``	
      - | Each instance of this pack type contains a single card or ``item``, chosen at random with replacement.
        | The probability of picking an item is proportional to its ``weight``, all filtered cards have weight 1.
    * - ``no replace``	
      - | Each instance of this pack type contains a single card or ``item``, chosen at random without replacement.
        | This means that the same card or item will not be chosen twice (if the set is large enough).<br/>
        | This is the default for pack types with a ``filter``.
    * - ``proportional``
      - | Each instance of this pack type contains a single filtered card or ``item``, chosen with probability proportional to the number of choices for the card/item.
        | The choice is made with replacement.
    * - ``nonempty``	
      - | Each instance of this pack type contains a single filtered card or ``item``,
        | but items that contain no cards will be ignored.
        | The choice is made with replacement.
    * - ``equal``	
      - Instead of choosing cards and items at random, they are chosen to make their numbers as equal as possible.
    * - ``equal proportional``
      - A combination of ``equal`` and ``proportional``.
    * - ``equal nonempty``
      - A combination of ``equal`` and ``nonempty``.
    * - ``first``	
      - | If there are any cards, the first is always chosen, otherwise the first ''nonempty'' item is used.<br/>
        | ``select: first`` can be used to make a kind of if statement: "If there are any X cards then use those, otherwise use Y cards".

**Examples**

.. code-block::

    pack item:
    	name: rare
    	select: no replace # this is optional, 'no replace' is the default
    	filter: card.rarity == "rare"

Rare cards are those with the rarity value of ``"rare"``.
The cards are chosen without replacement, so in a single pack the same rare will not occur twice.


.. code-block::

    pack item:
    	name: basic land
    	select: equal
    	filter: card.rarity == "basic land"

Basic land cards are selected in equal amounts:
Say a set contains two basic lands: "Good Land" and "Bad Land".
Then if 6 basic lands are selected, there will always be exactly 3 "Good Lands" and 3 "Bad Lands".
If an odd number of basic lands are selected then the amounts will be as close as possible to being equal.



.. code-block::

    pack type:
    	name: booster pack
    	select: all # this is optional, 'all' is the default
    	item:
    		name: rare
    		amount: 1
    	item:
    		name: uncommon
    		amount: 3
    	item:
    		name: common
    		amount: 11

A Magic booster pack contains 1 rare, 3 uncommons and 11 commons.


.. code-block::

    pack type:
    	name: special or else common
    	select: first
    	item: special
    	item: common

If there are any special cards in the set, then "special or else common" will be a special card, otherwise it will be a common.


.. code-block::

    pack type:
    	name: rare or mythic rare
    	select: proportional
    	item:
    		name: rare
    		weight: 2
    	item:
    		name: mythic rare
    		weight: 1

In Magic, individual "mythic rares" are twice as rare as normal rare cards.
Since there are also less mythic rares, this does not mean that each booster pack has a 33% percent chance of containing a mythic rare.
Instead the probability of a mythic rare is
``number_of_mythics / (number_of_rares * 2 + number_of_mythics)``.
So, for example if there are 20 rares in a set and only 5 mythic rares, then one in 9 "rare or mythic rare" cards will be a mythic rare.

Short form. Include a single common in this pack.


Symbol Font
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Overview**

A symbol font is a font for drawing with images.
Each :ref:`symbol font symbol|symbol-font-symbol` in the font is an image.

A symbol font is referenced in :ref:`stylesheet`s using a :ref:`symbol font reference`.

**Splitting**

A piece of text drawn with the symbol font is split into separate symbols.
The list of symbols in the font is scanned from top to bottom to find matches.

If the text is for instance "W/GR" and "W/G" should be rendered as a single symbol, then it should appear before the symbol "W".
Otherwise the "W" is seen as a symbol and the program continues with rendering "/GR".

**Font size**

A symbol font is drawn using a specific point size, similar to normal fonts.
Usually the images that make up the font are given in a very high resolution, for example 200x200.
This resolution could correspond to a point size of for instance 150pt.

When the symbol is drawn at for instance 12pt the image well then be scaled down to ``200/150*12 == 16`` pixels.

Sizes like margin, padding and font size are given in 'pixels per point'. If for instance

.. code-block::

     text margin left: 0.1
is specified, and the symbol is rendered at 12pt, the margin will be ``12*0.1 == 1.2`` pixels.

**Package format**

A symbol font is described in a :doc:`/file/package` with the ``.mse-symbol-font`` file extension.
Such a package contains a :doc:`/file/format|data file` called ``symbol-font`` that has the following properties.

**Properties**

It is recommended to only use functions in ``enabled``, so each stylesheet can determine how the font should be used.

.. code-block::

    symbol:
    	code: T
    	image: mana_t_old.png
    	enabled: { use_old_tap_symbol() }

Some of the items can contain placeholders for other values, for example:

.. code-block::

     undo: &Undo%s	Ctrl+Z
The ``%s`` is replaced by the name of the action to undo.
This ``%s`` should be used in exactly those entries that also contain it in the English locale.

**Examples**
Look at the ``"en.mse-locale"`` file in the standard MSE distribution for an example.

**Translating MSE**
To translate the MSE user interface:
* Create a copy of the ``"en.mse-locale"`` directory, name it ``"**.mse-locale"``, where ``"**"`` is a two or three letter [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_language_code|ISO language code`.
* Open the ``"locale"`` file with Notepad (or another program that supports UTF-8), and translate the strings.
* Add new keys for game, stylesheet or symbol font specific keys as described above.
* Save the file, select the new locale from Edit->Preferences.
* Restart MSE, and make sure everything looks right.
* Submit the new locale to the [[http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/forum/7|MSE forum].
* Maintain the locale when new versions of MSE come out. A new version may have new user interface items and therefore new keys.

**Overview**

A symbol file contains a symbol created with the symbol editor.

Symbols are not stored in packages, the data file is directly written to a ``".mse-symbol"`` file.

**Coordinates**

Various parts of a symbol use :ref:`vector2d|coordinates`.
These are pairs of numbers in the range ``0`` to ``1``. ``(0,0)`` is the top-left of the symbol, ``(1,1)`` the bottom-right.

For example the :ref:`value` of a 'text field' is a piece of text, that of a 'color field' a :ref:`color`, etc.

Things that are fields are, "card color" and "card name".
Not a particular color or name, but a description of what a card color and a card name are for a particular :ref:`game`.

Fields are part of the :doc:`/file/style triangle`:

**Example**
The ``title`` field gives the title of a set:

.. code-block::

    set field:
    	type: text
    	name: title
    	identifying: true

The border color of cards can be selected from a list of choices, but other values are also possible.
The default is based on a set field. Statistics don't make much sense for the border color.

.. code-block::

    card field:
    	type: color
    	name: border color
    	default: set.border_color
    	choice:
    		name: black
    		color: rgb(0,0,0)
    	choice:
    		name: white
    		color: rgb(255,255,255)
    	choice:
    		name: silver
    		color: rgb(128,128,128)
    	choice:
    		name: gold
    		color: rgb(200,180,0)
    	show statistics: false


Style
~~~~~

**Overview**

A style specifies how a :ref:`field` should look,
things like position, size, fonts, colors, etc.

Styles are part of the :doc:`/file/style triangle`:

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - Description	
      - Looks
      - Data
    * - :ref:`Game`	
      - :ref:`Stylesheet`
      - :ref:`Set`
    * - :ref:`Field`
      - '''Style'''	
      - :ref:`Value`

**Positioning**

<img src="style-positioning.png" alt="" style="float:right;border:1px solid #ccc;"/>
A style specifies the position of a box for the content.
To specify the horizontal location ''two'' of ``left``, ``width`` and ``right`` must be specified.

For example:

.. code-block::

     left:  10
     width: 20
Implies that ``right`` is 30 pixels.

Similarly:

.. code-block::

     left: 10
     right: 30
Implies the ``width`` is 20.

The same holds for the vertical location and size; ``top``, ``height`` and ``bottom``.

**Rotation**
Rotating a box can be done with the ``angle`` property.
The angle gives a counter clockwise rotation in degrees of the box.
The box is rotated such that the corner for which the position is specified is at the correct position after rotating.

Here are some examples:

|<img src="style-angle-examples.png" alt=""/>
	>red box:
	>       width:  30
	>       height: 25
	>       left:   10
	>       top:    20
	>       angle:  30
	
	>green box:
	>       width:  25
	>       height: 30
	>       left:   10
	>       top:    80
	>       angle:  90
	
	 	>blue box:
	 	>       width:  30
	 	>       height: 25
	 	>       right:  90
	 	>       bottom: 30
	 	>       angle:  30
	 	
	 	>yellow box:
	 	>       width:  20
	 	>       height: 35
	 	>       right:  60
	 	>       bottom: 60
	 	>       angle:  180

Keyword Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Overview**

A mode for :ref:`keyword`s.

This becomes a choice in the 'mode' box on the keywords panel.

**Example**
The 'number' parameter type. It matches a sequence of digits.
It can be included in the reminder text directly, or by applying some function first.

    		script: \{english_number({input})\}

Keyword Param Reference Script
______________________________

**Overview**

A way to use a :ref:`keyword param type|keyword parameter` in a :ref:`keyword`'s reminder text.

Usually the parameters are included as ``"{param1}"``, etc.
But in some cases for instance a function should be applied, ``"{fun(param1)}"``.

To make this easy for the user, a menu of choices is provided, this type describes such a choice.

**Properties**

**Example**
Apply the :doc:`/function#english_number` function to the parameter:

.. code-block::

    refer script:
    	name: as words
    	description: (one, two, three)
    	script: \{english_number({input})\}



Statistics Dimension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Overview**

A dimension or axis for the statistics panel.

One or more dimensions are combined in a graph, these combinations are called :ref:`statistics category`s.

Statistics dimensions are automatically generated for all card fields in a :ref:`game` that don't set ``show statistics`` to ``false``.

Categories are also automatically generated from dimensions.

A word can also be given in a short form, in that case only the name is specified.

**Example**
In short form:

.. code-block::

    word: xyz
Is the same as:

.. code-block::

        | <tr><td>type:</td><td>something</td></tr></table>
    * - :doc:`map <#map>`
      - Lists indexed by other text

List
~~~~

**File syntax**
In files a list is represented as multiple keys, one for each element.
The keys are all in the singular for of the name of the list,
if the list is named for instance ``symbols`` each key will be named ``symbol``.

.. code-block::

    symbol:
    	# first symbol here
    symbol:
    	# second symbol here
    # etc.

**Script syntax**
In a script lists can be declared using square brackets.

.. code-block::

     []    # An empty list
     [1]   # A list with a single element, the value 1
     [1,2] # A list with two elements

Lists can be accessed using either the bracket operator, or the dot operator.
The first element of a list is numbered 0, the next 1, etc.

.. code-block::

     list.0    # The first element of the list 'list'
     list[0]   # The same thing
     list[0+0] # The same thing

It is possible to iterate over lists using the ``for each`` construct:

.. code-block::

     for each x in [1,2,3] do "x = {x}. "
evaluates to:

.. code-block::

     "x = 1. x = 2. x = 3. "

**Functions**
There are several functions for working with lists:

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - :doc:`/function#position`	
      - Find the position of an element in a list
    * - :doc:`/function#number_of_items`
      - Return the number of items in a list
    * - :doc:`/function#sort_list`	
      - Sort a list
    * - :doc:`/function#filter_list`	
      - Filter a list, keeping only elements that match a predicate


Field Map
~~~~~~~~~

**Overview**

A 'field map' is a :ref:`map`, but indexed by :ref:`field`s.

For instance if a game specifies the fields:

.. code-block::

    field:
    	type: text
    	name: field1
    field:
    	type: color
    	name: field2

Then the a field map of ''things'' for those fields would look like:

.. code-block::

    field1: thing
    field2: thing

A field map of :ref:`style`s would be:

.. code-block::

    field1: # some text style for field1 goes here
    field2: # some color style for field2 goes here

And a field map of :ref:`value`s would be:

.. code-block::

    field1: text goes here
    field2: rgb(1,2,3)

**Script syntax**

In a script field maps can be accessed like normal :ref:`map`s based on the field name.
So:

.. code-block::

    card.field1 # retrieve the value of field1
    card["field" + 1] # the same thing
    card_style.field2 # retrieve the styling for field2


Map
~~~

A map is like a :ref:`list` with :ref:`string` keys.

**File syntax**
In files a map is represented as key/value pairs.
For instance a map of :ref:`color`s could be:

.. code-block::

    some map:
    	red:   rgb(255,0,0)
    	green: rgb(0,255,0)
    	blue:  rgb(0,0,255)

**Script syntax**
In a script maps can be declared using square brackets.

.. code-block::

     []      # An empty map
     [key:1] # A map with a single element, the value 1 under the key "key"
     [red:rgb(255,0,0), green:rgb(0,255,0)] # A map with two elements

Like lists, maps can be accessed using either the bracket operator, or the dot operator.

.. code-block::

     map.key       # The elment named "key"
     map["k"+"ey"] # The same thing

It is possible to iterate over the values maps using the ``for`` construct:

.. code-block::

     for each x in [one: 1, two: 2] do "x = {x}. "
evaluates to:

.. code-block::

     "x = 1. x = 2. "























Script Related
--------------

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 0
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - :doc:`script <#script>`
      - A script to execute to update a field, or for initialization.
    * - :doc:`scriptable <#scriptable>`
      - A primitive type whose value can depend on a script.
    * - :doc:`image <#image>`
      - An image defined by a script.
    * - :doc:`function <#function>`
      - Functions in scripts. These have no direct representation in a file.

Script
~~~~~~

**Overview**

A script object is a piece of code written in the [[script:index|MSE scripting language`.

**File syntax**

A script is given in the same way as a :ref:`string`.

**Example**
A simple :ref:`field` script that converts everything to upper case:

.. code-block::

    script: to_upper(value)

A larger script, changes ``"y"``s to ``"x"``s and ``"a"``s to ``"b"``s:

.. code-block::

    script:
    	new_value := replace(value, match: "x", replace: "y")
    	new_value := replace(value, match: "a", replace: "b")
    	new_value


Scriptable
~~~~~~~~~~

**Overview**

Many :ref:`style` properties are ''scriptable''; their value can be changed by a script.

Consider for example:

.. code-block::

    left: 123
This defines that the left coordinate of a field is 123 pixels.
To script this you can write:

.. code-block::

    left: { if card.name == "" then 100 else 123 }
Now the left position depends on whether or not the name is empty.

**File syntax**
A 'scriptable something' can take three forms:
# It can be a regular 'something'
  >something: 123
# It can be a script that produces 'something', enclosed in curly braces:
  >something: {100 + 23}
# It can be a script that produces 'something', indented and preceded by ``script:``:
  >something:
  >	script: 100 + 23

Note: To use a multiline script the following does not work:

.. code-block::

    something: { 100 +
                 23 }
If the script has multiple lines, it must start on a new line, and be indented with a TAB:

.. code-block::

    something:
    	{ 100 +
    	  23 }
or

.. code-block::

    something:
    	script: 100 +
    	        23


Image
~~~~~

Images are generated using scripts.

It is either given using a :ref:`filename` or as the output of a function.

**File syntax**
The syntax for files is similair to that of :ref:`scriptable` properties:

.. code-block::

     image: image.png
     image: { "image.png" }
     image: { linear_blend(...) }

**Script syntax**
:ref:`Filename`s are implicitly converted to images as needed.

**See also**
The following functions transform images:

.. list-table::

    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

      - Return an image built into the program.


Function
~~~~~~~~

**Overview**
The [[script:index|scripting language` allows you to define custom functions.

**Syntax**
A piece of code enclosed in curly braces defines a function.

A function can be called using parentheses, for example ``function(argument:value)``.

**Composition**
Functions can be composed using the ``+`` operator, evaluating ``a + b`` first evaluates ``a`` and uses its result as ``input`` for ``b``:

.. code-block::

     example := to_upper + { "result == {input}" }
     example("xyz") == "result == XYZ"

Multiple functions can be changed together like this, this is especially convenient in combination with [[script:default arguments`.

**Example**

.. code-block::

     example := { a + b }
     example(a: 1, b: 2) == 3

String
~~~~~~

A string is just a piece of text.

**File syntax**
In files, strings are written just as their value:

.. code-block::

     string: this is some string
The whitespace at the beginning is removed by the program.
Multiline strings are written on a new line, indented by a TAB:

.. code-block::

     string:
    	This is a very long string
    	It contains a line break.

**Script syntax**
In scripts, strings are written between double quotes, ``"this is a string"``.
The backslash character is used to escape values:

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - Code
      - Represents
    * - ``\"``
      - A " character
    * - ``\{``
      - A { character
    * - ``\n``
      - A newline character (line break)
    * - ``\\``
      - A backslash
    * - ``\<``
      - An escaped &lt; for :ref:`tagged string`s.

Sections between curly braces are interpreted as script code, that is concatentated with the string, for example

.. code-block::

     "ab{1 + 1}c" == "ab2c"
This can be nested arbitrarily.

The ``+`` operator concatenates strings. Numbers and most other values are automatically converted to strings when needed. This conversion can be forced with the :doc:`/function#to_string` function.

Using the ``[]`` or ``.`` operator characters in a string can be selected. 0 is the first character:

.. code-block::

     "xyz"[0]  ==  "x"
     "xyz".0   ==  "x"  # same thing
     "xyz".1   ==  "y"
     "xyz".2   ==  "z"
It is an error to select characters outside the string

.. code-block::

     "xyz".10  # error

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - :ref:`tagged string`
      - A string containg tags.
    * - :doc:`/function#to_string`	
      - Convert any value to a :ref:`string`


Tagged String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Syntax**
Strings in :ref:`value|text values` can contain markup tags.
These tags affect the presentation and sometimes the behaviour of the text.

A tag is something like ``"<tag>some text</tag>"``, similar to HTML.
Tags are closed by the same tag with a ``/`` before it.

To represent the character ``"<"`` in a tagged string use ``"\<"`` in script code.
This is written as the character with code 1 in files.

**Basic markup**

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - Tag
      - Description
    * - ``<b>``
      - The text inside the tag is bold.
    * - ``<i>``
      - The text inside the tag is italic.
    * - ``<sym>``	
      - The text inside the tag is rendered as symbols, if a [[prop:style:symbol font` is set for the text box.
    * - ``<color:???>``	
      - The text inside the tag is rendered with the given :ref:`color`.
    * - ``<size:???>``	
      - The text inside the tag is rendered with the given font size in points, for example ``"<size:12>text</size>"`` makes the text 12 points. The text is scaled down proportionally when it does not fit in a text box and the ``scale down to`` attribute allows it.
    * - ``<font:???>``	
      - The text inside the tag is rendered with the given font family.
    * - ``<align:???>``
      - The block inside the tag is aligned with the given horizontal :ref:`alignment`
    * - ``<margin:??:??>``
      - The block inside the tag has additional left, right (optional), and top (optional) margins of the specified size in pixels.
    * - ``<li>``
      - The text inside the tag is treated as a list marker, meaning that if the line wraps it will be indented to match the content of the ``<li>`` tag.
    * - ``<line>``	
      - Line breaks inside this tag use the [[prop:style:line height line`, and they show a horizontal line.
    * - ``<soft-line>``	
      - Line breaks inside this tag use the [[prop:style:soft line height`.
    * - ``<atom>``	
      - | An atomic piece of text. The cursor can never be inside it; it is selected as a whole.
        | The program automatically inserts ``<atom-soft>``.
    * - ``<code>``	
      - The text inside the tag is rendered in a monospace font. This is used for syntax highlighting script code.
    * - ``<code-kw>``	
      - The text inside the tag is highlighted as a keyword in source code.
    * - ``<code-str>``	
      - The text inside the tag is highlighted as a string in source code.

**Other tags**

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - Tag
      - Description
    * - ``<kw-?>``	
      - | Indicates that the text inside it is a keyword. This tag is automatically inserted by
        | The :doc:`/function#expand_keywords` function.<br/>
        | There are four versions, indicating whether or not reminder text is shown:
        | * ``<kw-0>``, Reminder text hidden, by default
        | * ``<kw-1>``, Reminder text shown, by default
        | * ``<kw-a>``, Reminder hidden manually
        | * ``<kw-A>``, Reminder shown manually
    * - ``<sep>``	
      - | A separator between fields. This tag is automatically inserted by the :doc:`/function#combined_editor` function.<br/>
        | Inserting this tag manually will confuse that function!<br/>
        | This tag can never be selected, and its contents can not be edited.
    * - ``<prefix>``	
      - At the beginning of a string, indicates a part that can not be selected. This tag is automatically inserted by the :doc:`/function#combined_editor` function.
    * - ``<suffix>``	
      - At the end of a string, indicates a part that can not be selected. This tag is automatically inserted by the :doc:`/function#combined_editor` function.
    * - ``<sep-soft>``	
      - Like ``<sep>``, only hidden. This is inserted by :doc:`/function#combined_editor`
    * - ``<soft>``	
      - Text who's width is ignored for alignment, similar to ``<sep-soft>``, but not a separator.
    * - ``<word-list-???>``
      - | Indicate that the text inside the tag should be selected from a :ref:`word list`.
        | The ``???`` must be the name of a word list in the game.
    * - ``<error>``	
      - The text inside the tag is an error, and is shown with a red wavy underline.
    * - ``<error-spelling:???>``
      - | A spelling error, marked by the :doc:`/function#:check_spelling` function.
        | The ``???`` part indicates the language used for spelling checking.
    * - any other tag	
      - Other tags are ignored.


**Related functions**
The following script functions deal with tags:

    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - :doc:`/function#tag_contents`

Localized String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A 'localized string' is a :ref:`map` of :ref:`:string`s, indexed by locale name.
It is used to translate games and stylesheets to other user interface languages.

Localized strings can be given with a ``localized`` prefix on the property name.
For example, a field has a ``description`` which is a :ref:`:string`, and a ``localized_description`` for localized variants. So


.. code-block::

    field:
    	name: cost
    	description: How much this card costs
    	localized description:
    		en_US: How much this card costs
    		nl_NL: Hoeveel deze kaart kost


Filename
~~~~~~~~

Filenames are regular :ref:`string`s, pointing to a file.
There are two types of filenames, relative and absolute:

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - Syntax	
      - Description
    * - ``path/to/file``
      - | A relative file, this is retrieved from the current package.
        | i.e. for a filename in a stylesheet, the file is retrieved from that stylesheet.
    * - ``/package/path/to/file``
      - An absolute filename includes the name of the package. This is a package somewhere in the MSE data directory.

Don't forget the double quotes (``""``) in scripts.

**Dependencies**
When using an absolute filename to refer to a file from another :doc:`/file/package`,
the :ref:`dependency` on that package must be declared.
For example,

.. code-block::

    include file: /common.mse-include/something
Will give a warning message, unless the file also lists

.. code-block::

    depends on:
    	package: common.mse-include
    	version: 2007-01-01


Dependency
__________

**Overview**

:ref:`Package`s can depend on other packages.
For example a :ref:`stylesheet` needs a particular version of the corresponding :ref:`game` package, and maybe some additional :ref:`include`s.

**Properties**

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - ``package``
      - :ref:`string`	
      - Filename of the package this package depends on.
    * - ``version``
      - :ref:`version`
      - Minimal version of that package that is required.

The two properties can also be written on a single line, separated by a space (see the examples).

**Example**
The magic-new stylesheet depends on a particular version of the game file:

.. code-block::

    depends on:
    	package: magic.mse-game
    	version: 2007-06-06
This can be written more compactly as

.. code-block::

    depends on: magic.mse-game 2007-06-06



Regex
~~~~~

Regular expressions (regexes) are things that can match parts of :ref:`string`s.

Regexes are represented by normal :ref:`string`s.
Note that to escape something in a regex the backslash is used, in script code this also needs to be escaped.
For example, in a script, the regex matching a single backslash is ``"\\\\"``.

For more information, see
[[http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/stable/wx_wxresyn.html|the wxWidgets regular expression documentation`.


Boolean
~~~~~~~

A boolean is either ``true`` or ``false``.

In a script, numbers are implicitly converted to booleans, a non-zero number is ``true``, 0 is ``false``.

When converted to a number, ``true`` becomes ``1`` and ``false`` becomes ``0``.

The strings ``"yes"`` and ``"no"`` can also be converted to booleans.

**File syntax**

.. code-block::

     boolean: true
     boolean: false

**Script syntax**

.. code-block::

     true or false

The operators ``or``, ``and`` and ``xor`` combine two booleans:

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - ``a``	
      - ``b``	
      - ``a or b``
      - ``a and b``
      - ``a xor b``
    * - ``false``
      - ``false``	
      - ``false``	
      - ``false``	
      - ``false``
    * - ``false``
      - ``true``	
      - ``true``	
      - ``false``	
      - ``true``
    * - ``true``
      - ``false``	
      - ``true``	
      - ``false``	
      - ``true``
    * - ``true``
      - ``true``	
      - ``true``	
      - ``true``	
      - ``false``

Int
~~~

Integer numbers are numbers without a decimal point.
In many cases negative numbers don't make sense, but the program never complains about them.

**File syntax**

.. code-block::

     something: 123

**Script syntax**

.. code-block::

     123 + 456 * -1

**See also**

.. list-table::

    * - :ref:`double`	
      - Number type that can contain fractional values.
    * - :doc:`/function#to_int`	
      - Convert a value to an integer number


Double
~~~~~~

Real or floating point numbers are numbers with a decimal point.

Conversion from integer to real numbers happens automatically in scripting.

**File syntax**

.. code-block::

     something: 123
     something: 0.5

**Script syntax**

.. code-block::

     123.1 + 456 * -1

**See also**

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - :ref:`int`	
      - Integer numbers
    * - :doc:`/function#to_real`
      - Convert a value to a real number


Version
~~~~~~~

**File syntax**
A version number consists of three components, in the form "a.b.c".
Higher numbers mean newer versions.

The version number can also be a date, of the form "YYYY-MM-DD"

**Examples**

.. code-block::

     version: 1.2.3
     version: 2007-07-12


Color
~~~~~

**Syntax**
In files and scritps a color can be represented as
<pre><span class='hl-kw'>rgb</span>(*red_component*, *green_component*, *blue_component*)</pre>
where red_component, green_component and blue_component are numbers between 0 and 255 (inclusive).

In most places MSE also supports colors with a transparency value, notated as
<pre><span class='hl-kw'>rgba</span>(*red_component*, *green_component*, *blue_component*, *alpha_component*)</pre>
An alpha value of ``0`` indicates a transparent color, an alpha value of ``255`` is completely opaque.

You can also use HTML style hexadecimal colors,
<pre>#*rgb*, #*rgba*, #*rrggbb*, #*rrggbbaa*</pre>
For example, ``#ff0000`` is red, as is ``#f00``

**Named colors**
MSE also supports named colors, for instance ``"white"`` is the same as ``rgb(255,255,255)``.
For a full list of supported colors, see [[https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/classwx_colour_database.html|the wxWidgets documentation`.
In addition, the named color ``"transparent"`` stands for the completely transparent color, ``rgba(0,0,0,0)``.

In scripts named colors are represented as :ref:`string`s.

**Examples**
For example:

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - Code
      - Represents	
      - <<<
    * - ``rgb(255,255,255)``
      - white
      - <div style="border:1px solid black; background:white;width:30px;height:15px;"> </div>
    * - ``rgb(0,0,0)``	
      - black
      - <div style="border:1px solid black; background:black;width:30px;height:15px;"> </div>
    * - ``rgb(255,0,0)``
      - red
      - <div style="border:1px solid black; background:red;  width:30px;height:15px;"> </div>
    * - ``rgb(0,255,0)``
      - green
      - <div style="border:1px solid black; background:rgb(0,255,0);width:30px;height:15px;"> </div>
    * - ``rgb(0,0,255)``
      - blue
      - <div style="border:1px solid black; background:blue; width:30px;height:15px;"> </div>
    * - ``rgba(0,0,0,0)``
      - transparent	
      - <div style="border:1px solid black; width:30px;height:15px;text-align:center;">over</div>
    * - ``rgba(255,0,0,128)``
      - transparent red	
      - <div style="border:1px solid black; background:rgb(255,128,128);color:rgb(128,0,0);width:30px;height:15px;text-align:center;">over</div>
    * - ``rgba(0,0,255,192)``
      - transparent blue
      - <div style="border:1px solid black; background:rgb(64,64,255);color:rgb(0,0,192);width:30px;height:15px;text-align:center;">over</div>

Date
~~~~

DOC_MSE_VERSION: since 0.3.8

A point in time, consisting of a date and a time.
The file syntax uses [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601|ISO 8601` notation.

**File syntax**

.. code-block::

     something: 2008-12-31 23:59:59

**See also**

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1

      - Convert a value to a date
    * - :doc:`/function#to_string`
      - Convert dates to strings



Choice
~~~~~~

A possible choice for a choice :ref:`field`.

**Properties**

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :align: left

    * - Property	
      - Type
      - Default	
      - Description
    * - ``name``	
      - :ref:`string`	
      - ''Required''
      - Name of this choice, displayed in the drop down list.
    * - ``line below``	
      - :ref:`boolean`
      - ``false``	
      - Display a line below this item?
    * - ``group choice``
      - :ref:`string`	
      - ''no''	
      - Can this submenu of choices itself be selected?
    * - ``choices``	
      - :ref:`list` of :ref:`choice`s
      -  
      - Submenu of choices.
    * - ``enabled``	
      - :ref:`scriptable` :ref:`boolean`
      -  
      - Is this choice selectable?
    * - ``type``	
      - ``"check"`` or ``"radio"``
      - ``"check"``
      - | How should this choice be displayed? As a checkbox or a radio box?<br/>
        | Only applies to multiple choice fields.

A choice can also be given in a short form, in that case only the name is specified.

**Names**

The full name of a choice is that of the choice and its parents, separated by spaces.
This is the value actually stored in values and manipulated by scripts.

For example

.. code-block::

    field:
    	type: choice
    	choice:
    		name: large
    		choice: red
    		choice: blue
    	choice:
    		name: small
    		group choice: just small
    		choice: green
    		choice: yellow

The choice red is called ``"large red"``, while green is ``"small green"``.
The group choice 'just small' gets the name of the group, ``"small"``.

**Example**
In short form:

.. code-block::

    choice: apples
Is the same as:

.. code-block::

    choice:
    	name: apples

Color Choice

     (x-coordinate,y-coordinate)
For example

.. code-block::

     (0.5,0.5)

**Script syntax**
Vectors can not be represented in script syntax.
